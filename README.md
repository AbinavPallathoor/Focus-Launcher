# Focus Launcher

A minimalist Android home-screen launcher built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Pure black
background, white text, monospace font, no app icons, no clutter — just a clock, two
gesture-driven radial dials for quick app launching, and a full-text search.

## Features

- **Dot-matrix clock** — a 5×3 segmented-display clock (`HH:mm`), with the date
  (`DD/MM/YY`) and today's screen time flanking it at the bottom-left/right. Everything
  below the clock — that row and the calendar block — is pinned to the clock's own
  measured width, so long text truncates with an ellipsis instead of stretching the block
  wider than the clock.
- **Two radial dial menus**, stacked in the bottom-right corner:
  - Pull from either handle and rotate through the arc to light up an app; the selected
    app's name glides into a left-side callout box as you rotate. Release to launch.
  - The bottom dial sweeps a 90° quarter-circle; the upper dial sweeps a full 180°.
  - Node spacing grows automatically so apps never overlap, however many are assigned.
  - The pull handle has a generous invisible touch zone around it (much bigger than the
    visible dot) so it's easy to find without looking, and once you've pulled far enough
    from the anchor, releasing always launches the nearest app — a direction that's
    slightly outside the arc still resolves to the nearest edge app instead of launching
    nothing.
- **Swipe up** anywhere on the home screen to open search. Results appear instantly as
  you type, with the top (most likely) match highlighted and launched immediately once
  typing narrows to a single app (no debounce — it opens the moment it's unambiguous) or
  on pressing Enter.
- **Swipe left / right** on the home screen trigger quick actions — Camera and Contacts
  by default, both overridable. **Swipe down** pulls down the system notification shade,
  same as it would from any other app.
- **Next calendar event** — shown in a bordered box below the date/screen-time row: title
  (truncated with an ellipsis if long) and a `> `-prefixed start–end time, read straight
  from the device's calendar provider (whatever's synced from a Google account already
  on-device — no separate sign-in).
- **Long-press an app** in search to reveal an inline action panel — filled monochrome
  icons (same pack, same size) for Uninstall, Rename, Hide, and Close, sliding in from the
  right edge of that same row (no separate popup), separated from the app name by a thin
  divider. A long name is simply covered by the panel's own opaque background rather than
  being clipped right at the divider. While held, the row's border fills in white (or black
  on the highlighted top match) proportional to how long you've been pressing, fading out
  on release.
  - Rename sets a launcher-only display name used everywhere the app appears.
  - Hide removes it from search while keeping any dial/gesture assignment working.
- **Settings** (long-press the clock) — grouped into labeled sections, in order: Gestures,
  Dial position, Upper dial, Bottom dial, Hidden apps, each under a thin divider. The two dial sections show a small radial replica of the actual on-screen dial —
  the same arc, in the same corner — instead of a plain list, so it's immediately obvious
  which pull direction launches which app. Tap a node to assign/replace that slot;
  long-press a filled one to clear it. A slider above them nudges both dials up together
  (keeping the spacing between them) for devices/preferences where the default position
  isn't ideal. Gesture overrides and unhiding apps are still plain rows.
- Status bar is hidden, and system window/activity-open animations are disabled for this
  activity, so the home screen reads as the persistent OS shell rather than an app that
  keeps opening and closing on top of it.
- **Fast to surface** — pressing Home never waits on anything: the installed-app list,
  screen time, and calendar are all loaded off the main thread, and if you'd left the
  launcher on Search/Settings it resets to Home while hidden, so there's no crossfade to sit
  through when you come back.

## Building

Requires Android Studio (or a local Gradle + Android SDK install). `minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 34`.

1. Open the project in Android Studio, or with Gradle and the Android SDK installed locally,
   create a `local.properties` file pointing at your SDK (`sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/sdk`).
2. Build the **release** variant — `gradle assembleRelease` — and install
   `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`. It's R8-shrunk (under 1 MB) and signed
   with the local debug key, so it installs directly. Prefer it over the debug build for
   daily use: debug Compose builds are unoptimized and noticeably slower to draw.
3. Set it as the default launcher from Android Settings.

### Permissions

- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` — to list all installed apps (default launchers are generally
  exempt from the stricter package-visibility rules, but this is declared for reliability
  across OEM skins).
- `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` — for the screen-time display. This is a special permission the
  user must grant manually under Settings → Apps → Special access → Usage access; the
  launcher prompts for it (tap "Enable screen time" on the home screen).
- `READ_CALENDAR` — for the upcoming-event display, requested at runtime (tap "Enable
  calendar" on the home screen).
- `KILL_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES` — for the "Close" action in an app's long-press menu.
- `EXPAND_STATUS_BAR` — a normal, auto-granted permission used to pull down the
  notification shade on swipe-down, the same way every other custom launcher does (there's
  no public API for this, just a long-standing reflection call against the hidden
  `StatusBarManager`).

## Known limitations

- Fonts: body text uses Android's built-in monospace typeface (no network dependency).
- Screen time requires the manual Usage Access grant described above; until granted, the
  home screen shows "Enable screen time" instead of a duration.
- "Close" is a best-effort background-process kill (`killBackgroundProcesses`) — Android
  doesn't let one app force-stop another's foreground activity, so this mainly helps with
  apps already in the background.
- The calendar event comes from whatever's already synced to the device's local calendar
  provider; there's no in-app Google account sign-in.
